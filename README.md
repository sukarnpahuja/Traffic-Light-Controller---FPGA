# Traffic-Light-Controller---FPGA
The traffic in road crossings /junctions is controlled
by switching ON/OFF Red, Green & Yellow lights in a
particular sequence. The Traffic Light Controller is designed
to generate a sequence of digital data called switching
sequences that can be used to control the traffic lights of a
typical four roads junction in a fixed sequence. It plays more
and more important role in modern management and control
of urban traffic to reduce the accident and traffic jam in road.
It is a sequential machine to be analyzed and programmed
through a multistep process. The device that involves an
analysis of existing sequential machines in traffic lights
controllers, timing and synchronization and introduction of
operation and flashing light synthesis sequence. The methods
that are used in this project are design the circuit, write a
coding, simulation, synthesis and implement in hardware. In
this project, ALTERA QUARTUS II Software is chosen to
design a schematic using schematic edit, writes a coding
using Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) text
editor and implements the circuit on FPGA BOARD.
